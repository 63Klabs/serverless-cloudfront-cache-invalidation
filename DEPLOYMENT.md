## Overview

The enhanced system includes the following new capabilities:

- **CloudFormation Parameters**: System-wide default configuration values
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Per-bucket consolidation settings via S3 bucket tags
- **Consolidation Stop Level**: Control consolidation depth to prevent over-consolidation
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive configuration decision logging

### Features

1. **CloudFormation Parameters**:
   - `DirectoryConsolidationThreshold` (default: 3)
   - `SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold` (default: 10)
   - `ConsolidationStopLevel` (default: 1)
   - `AggregationWindowSeconds` (default: 300)
   - `OriginPathPattern` (default: `/{stageId}/public`)

2. **Bucket Tags for Configuration**:
   - `invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold` (1-1000)
   - `invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold` (1-1000)
   - `invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel` (0-20)
   - `invalidator:OriginPathPattern` (e.g., `/{stageId}/public`, `/assets`, `/`)

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing deployments continue to work without changes

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- AWS CLI v2.0 or later
- AWS SAM CLI v1.50 or later
- Python 3.9 or later
- Git
- Highly Recommended: 63Klabs Atlantis Platform Tempates and Scripts for ready-to-run deployment

### Required Permissions

Your AWS credentials must have permissions for:

- CloudFormation stack operations
- Lambda function deployment
- IAM role creation and management
- S3 bucket operations
- SQS queue operations
- DynamoDB table operations
- EventBridge scheduler operations
- CloudWatch logs and alarms

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Verify AWS CLI configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify SAM CLI installation
sam --version
```

## Deployment Steps

This application is **Ready-to-Deploy-and-Run** with the [63Klabs Atlantis DevOps Platform for Serverless Deployments on AWS](https://atlantis.63klabs.net)

Like any other project, you can skip the Atlantis platform and go at it on your own using `sam deploy` from the CLI within the application-infrastructure directory.

However, the [Atlantis DevOps Platform](https://atlantis.63klabs.net) is highly recommended for individual developers and small teams as it implements Platform Engineering, AWS best practices, and deployment automation. It utilizes AWS native resources including SAM deployments and CloudFormation without the need of proprietary DevOps tools. Everything is API, CloudFormation template, and SAM CLI based as well as AI-ready.

### Step 1: Review Configuration Options

Before deployment, decide on your configuration strategy:

#### Option A: Use Default Configuration
- DirectoryConsolidationThreshold: 3
- SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold: 10
- ConsolidationStopLevel: 1
- OriginPathPattern: `/{stageId}/public`
- No additional parameters needed

#### Option B: Custom System-Wide Configuration
- Set CloudFormation parameters for your environment
- All buckets use these defaults unless overridden

#### Option C: Mixed Configuration
- Set reasonable CloudFormation defaults
- Use bucket tags for specific overrides

### Step 2: Plan Naming Conventions

Atlantis uses the following naming conventions:

- **PREFIX**: Pre-determined by your organization
- **PROJECT_ID**: Unique identifier for your project. Suggestion: `cdn-invalidator-svc` (Suggested max is 20 characters and the length of Prefix + Project ID should not exceed 28 characters.)
- **YOUR_REPO_NAME**: The name of your repository. Suggestion: `cloudfront-invalidator-service`
- **MY_STATIC_ASSETS**: The name of a new static assets bucket (for testing). This will be incorporated into a unique bucket name. Suggestion: `my-cool-static-assets` (You can create multiple buckets and it is always a good idea to have a few test buckets to experiment with various configurations)

### Step 3: Create and Ready the Repository

Infrastructure deployment using the 63Klabs Atlantis DevOps Platform are orchestrated from your organization's SAM Configuration repository.

The following steps are performed from the command line from within the SAM Configuration repository.

```bash
# Use the create_repo script to create, configure, and seed a repository with the Cache Invalidator
./cli/create_repo.py YOUR_REPO_NAME --source https://github.com/63Klabs/serverless-cloudfront-cache-invalidation --profile default
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Invalidator Service Pipeline and Application Stack

```bash
# Create a pipeline for the test branch
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX YOUR_PROJECT_ID test --profile default
# Choose template-pipeline.yml (CodeCommit source) or template-pipeline-github.yml

# Deploy the pipeline (if you didn't choose to deploy right away from the config script)
./cli/deploy.py pipeline PREFIX YOUR_PROJECT_ID test --profile default
```

Once the pipeline is created the first deployment will automatically kick off. You can follow it in the web console using the link provided in the Output.

Make sure it deploys without errors before going to the `dev` branch and making changes.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone HTTPS_CLONE_URL

cd YOUR_CLONED_REPO

git switch dev
```
```bash
## -------------------------
## DEPLOY INVALIDATOR STACK - TEST

# Note: We will use the ProjectId of cdn-invalidator but it can be anything
#       For now we will just deploy a test instance of the stack and have
#       Our buckets and distributions use that.

# Create the test environment and deploy
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX cdn-invalidator test
# > When prompted:
#   Choose template-pipeline.yml (or template-pipeline-github.yml if deploying from a gh repo)
#   Follow the stack parameter prompts (leave S3StaticHostBucket blank)

# Don't forget to deploy if you skipped deployment during config
./cli/deploy.py pipeline PREFIX cdn-invalidator test
```

Once the pipeline is created the first deployment will automatically kick off. You can follow it in the web console using the link provided in the Output.

Make sure it deploys without errors before going making changes to the application.

Once the Invalidator Application stack has deployed, go to the `PREFIX-cdn-invalidator-test-application` stack's Output section in the web console and copy `CloudFrontCacheInvalidatorArn`. You will need this for your S3 bucket configuration.

### Step 5: Deploy the S3 Buckets

The following steps are performed from the command line from within the SAM CONFIG repository.

```bash
## -------------------------
## CREATE THE S3 BUCKET THAT WILL SERVE AS THE STATIC WEB HOST
## The bucket will store both test and prod static assets

./cli/config.py storage PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS --profile default
# > CHOOSE TEMPLATE: template-storage-s3-oac-for-cloudfront.yml
# > SET PARAMETER: CloudFrontCacheInvalidatorArn
# > Copy the following from OUTPUTS
# - BucketName
# - OriginBucketDomainForCloudFront

# Don't forget to deploy if you skipped deployment during config
./cli/deploy.py storage PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS --profile default
```

### Step 6: Deploy the CloudFront Distribution

- You will need the `OriginBucketDomainForCloudFront` from the storage stack outputs.
- When configuring the CloudFront distribution, you will need to add a new tag: `AllowInvalidationEvents=true`

```bash
## -------------------------
## CREATE THE CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTIONS
## You do not need a domain name for testing

# Note: By design, cache invalidations are processed ONLY for PROD (stage, beta, prod) instances
# To fully test you will need both a TEST (test) and PROD (stage/beta/prod) instance

# Because the bucket uses OAC for security, you will need a cloudfront distribution
# A custom domain record in Route 53 is optional
# For now you can just use the CloudFront distribution url for testing and add a custom domain later

./cli/config.py network PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS test --profile default
# > Choose template-network-route53-cloudfront-s3-apigw.yml (it does not require api gateway)
# > SET PARAMETERS
# - You will need the OriginBucketDomainForCloudFront from the storage stack outputs
# > ADD NEW TAG: AllowInvalidationEvents=true

# Don't forget to deploy if you skipped deployment during config
./cli/deploy.py network PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS test --profile default

# All uploads to test/public are skipped, so to actually see invalidations you will need a PROD instance

# Use the same template and prompts answers as before. 
# Don't forget:
# - PARAMETER: OriginBucketDomainForCloudFront
# - ADD NEW TAG: AllowInvalidationEvents=true
./cli/config.py network PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS prod --profile default
./cli/deploy.py network PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS prod --profile default
```

### Step 7: Test

The following are performed from the command line from within the Invalidator Service repository.

Make sure you followed the steps to deploy both a PROD and TEST network stack. Invalidations are only sent to production resources.

```bash
## -------------------------
## TEST
## Using the resource list in the invalidator stack, you should be able to go 
## In via the console and check logs and queues. 
## (You will have a 5 minute window as events are processed in 5 minutes)
## Validate both test and prod behavior in 
## DynamoDb, SQS, Events, Lambda Logs and CloudFront Dist invalidation requests

# A test file is available in the root of this repo. Increment the target file name on each copy
aws s3 cp test.html s3://BUCKET_NAME/test/public/test-1.html
# - The Ingestor function should accept and then filter OUT the event (it is in test)
# Copy to S3 prod location
aws s3 cp test.html s3://BUCKET_NAME/prod/public/test-2.html
# The Ingestor function should accept and schedule an invalidation. It should be listed in SQS and DynamoDB
# The Processor function should kick in after 5 minutes and submit an invalidation

# Test a bunch of files at once:
cd application-infrastructure/build-scripts
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME

# Test with custom origin path pattern (if your bucket uses a non-standard structure):
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /app/{stageId}

# Test with static origin path (no stage placeholder):
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /static --stages prod
```

#### Upload Test Files Utility Options

The `upload-test-files.py` utility supports several options for testing different bucket configurations:

**Basic Usage**:
```bash
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME
```

**Custom Origin Path Pattern**:

Use the `--origin_path` option to test buckets with non-standard directory structures:

```bash
# Test with custom pattern using stage placeholder
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /app/{stageId}
# Uploads to: /app/prod/, /app/stage/, /app/beta/

# Test with static path (no stage placeholder)
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /static --stages prod
# Uploads to: /static/

# Test with custom assets directory
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /{stageId}/assets
# Uploads to: /prod/assets/, /stage/assets/, /beta/assets/
```

**Pattern Format Rules**:
- Must start with `/` (e.g., `/app/{stageId}`)
- Can include `{stageId}` placeholder for dynamic stage substitution
- Trailing slash is optional (automatically added)
- Default pattern: `/{stageId}/public`

**Common Test Scenarios**:

```bash
# Test default pattern (current behavior)
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME

# Test legacy bucket with flat structure
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets LEGACY_BUCKET --origin_path /public --stages prod

# Test multiple buckets with different patterns
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_A --origin_path /{stageId}/public
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_B --origin_path /static --stages prod
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_C --origin_path /{stageId}/assets

# Test specific stages with custom pattern
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --stages prod,stage --origin_path /app/{stageId}

# Verbose output for debugging
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /app/{stageId} --verbose
```

**Validation**:

The utility validates the origin path pattern before uploading:
- Pattern must start with `/`
- Invalid patterns display clear error messages with examples
- Validation occurs before any S3 operations

**Example Error**:
```bash
$ python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path app/{stageId}
Error: Origin path must start with '/'. Invalid value: 'app/{stageId}'.
Examples: /app/{stageId}, /static, /{stageId}/public
```

### Step 8: Clone Repository

Note that all changes must be made in the `dev` branch and merged to `test` branch to kick off a deployment.

Clone your cache invalidator repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone HTTPS_CLONE_URL

cd YOUR_CLONED_REPO

git switch dev
```

### Step 9: Move to Production

The above commands using the Atlantis CLI scripts only deployed a TEST instance of the invalidator service. When ready to use it in production you should deploy a production instance and reconfigure your S3 buckets to use the PRODUCTION invalidator ARN. 

It is useful to keep a test instance of the invalidator for testing any custom changes. To have the S3 bucket submit events to a different invalidator instance just re-run the `config.py` script for that storage stack and set the `CloudFrontCacheInvalidatorArn` parameter to point to the alternate instance.

### Removing Invalidation from a Bucket

To remove invalidation from your storage stack just re-run the `config.py` script fo that storage stack and leave the `CloudFrontCacheInvalidatorArn` blank by entering a dash `-` (otherwise it will remain the set value).

## Configuration

### System-Wide Configuration (CloudFormation Parameters)

These parameters set default values for any bucket that doesn't override them.

Update the `application-infrastructure/template-configuration.json` file to include parameter overrides for your application stack.

```json
"Parameters": {
    "IngestorMemoryInMB": "1024",
    "ProcessorMemoryInMB": "1024",
    "DirectoryConsolidationThreshold": "5",
    "SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold": "5",
    "ConsolidationStopLevel": "2",
    "AggregationWindowSeconds": "60",
    "OriginPathPattern": "/"
}
```

(For valid values, see [CONFIGURATION_TROUBLESHOOTINGmd](./CONFIGURATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md))

> Note: You may change the tag configuration in `template-configuration.json` as well. Just do not update any placeholder variables (ie `$PLACEHOLDER$`) or tags with key names starting with `atlantis`.

### Per-Bucket Configuration (S3 Bucket Tags)

Bucket tagging should be performed using the Atlantis SAM Configuration scripts `config.py` and `deploy.py` to maintain configurations specified in your SAM Configuration infrastructure repository is reflective of actual cloud state.

#### Redploy S3 Bucket with Updated Tags

```bash
./cli/config.py storage PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS

# Keep all parameters the same, but when you reach TAGS add new tags with your new values:
invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold=15
invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold=15
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=3
invalidator:OriginPathPattern=/web/@stageId/public

# Deploy changes if you skipped deployment during config
./cli/deploy.py storage PREFIX MY_STATIC_ASSETS
```

#### Manual (temporary) for Testing

performing these steps manually will allow you to test the bucket tagging configuration quickly, but will make your resources drift from the configuration reflected in CloudFormation and your SAM Config repository.

Any changes to the bucket tags will be lost if you redeploy the stack.

> Production systems should ONLY be updated through CloudFormation and Infrastructure as Code

You can update the bucket tags through the S3 web console, or via the CLI.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging \
  --bucket your-bucket-name \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[
    {Key=AllowInvalidationEvents,Value=true},
    {Key=invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold,Value=10},
    {Key=invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold,Value=5},
    {Key=invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel,Value=0}
  ]'
```

#### Configuration Examples

CloudFront charges by the number of invalidation paths received NOT by the number of files invalidated.

For example, if you need to invalidate 1,000 files within a single `sample` directory, you will be charged for 1,000 invalidations if you invalidate per file vs. if you just invalidate the entire directory `sample/*`.

Therefore, to keep your cache invalidation costs low, you want to balance how much you need precise file invalidation vs the threshold of which you begin to consolidate paths. Also, how often, and at what rate, do you expect the files to change?

> Note: The following examples are not exhaustive and are intended to give you a general idea of how to configure your buckets. You will need to adjust the thresholds and stop levels to your specific needs. Monitor your buckets and CloudFront distribution invalidations to prevent any unwanted charges.

**Entire Bucket (Scorched Earth Consolidation)**:

File level caching doesn't matter to you, so you want to invalidate everything.

```bash
# Even if only a single file changes, invalidate the entire cache at the root
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=0
```

**High-Invalidation Bucket (Aggressive Consolidation)**:

Batches of files change and you want invalidation costs to be low.

```bash
# Consolidate at 2 files, 3 sibling directories, allow root consolidation
invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold=2
invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold=3
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=1
```

**Low-Invalidation Bucket (Conservative Consolidation)**:

File invalidation is prefered, but if nearby files and directories change at a high rate, consolidate to reduce costs along that path.

```bash
# Consolidate at 20 files, 25 sibling directories, prevent deep consolidation
invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold=20
invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold=25
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=4
```

**Media Assets Bucket (Minimal Consolidation)**:

Expected low numbers of assets (images, audio, and videos) to be changed at a time and rare.

> IMPORTANT! If you process media before uploading to S3, which may result in 10s, 100s, or 1000s separate files to be generated (such as HLS) use the Streaming Video, Audio, or Derivatives method!

```bash
# High thresholds, prevent most consolidation
invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold=100
invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold=50
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=5
```

**Streaming Video, Audio, or Derivatives (High Consolidation)**:

This is a HUGE gotcha if you are processing video through Elemental Media before uploading to S3.

A single 60 second video clip, when processed and uploaded for web content delivery, can actually balloon to 100s or even 1000s of files. It is important to organize each clip within its own directory that contains all the formats (HLS, Audio, MP4, SD, HD, UHD, etc) so that consolidation can happen at the clip's directory level.

For high traffic sites (with both high volumes of viewers and uploaders) you want consolidation to occur at the clip level, but not closer to the root, otherwise you will continally invalidate your entire cache at the root `/*`.

For this, you will want to stop consolidation before it hits the root level.

```bash
# Low thresholds, prevent consolidation at root level
invalidator:DirectoryConsolidationThreshold=2
invalidator:SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold=2
invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=2
```

Example structure:

```
public/
 | - clip-1/
 |   | - HLS/
 |   |   | - 00000.x
 |   |   | - 00001.x
 |   |   | - ....
 |   | - MP4/
 |   |   | - UHD.mp4
 |   |   | - HD.mp4
 |   |   | - SD.mp4
 |   |   | - ....
 |   | - MOV/ ....
 |   | - MKV/ ....
 | - clip-2/
 |   | - HLS/ ....
 |   | - MP4/ ....
 |   | - MOV/ ....
 |   | - MKV/ ....
 | - clip-3/
 |   | - HLS/ ....
 |   | - MP4/ ....
 |   | - MOV/ ....
 |   | - MKV/ ....
```

When `clip-4` and `clip-5` are uploaded, the cache will be invalidated at `clip-4/*` and `clip-5/*` and will not affect any existing clips as consolidation stops before root. If `invalidator:ConsolidationStopLevel=1` then it would send an invalidation for ALL video directories at the root level `/*` due to the fact that the threshold was low (`2`) and there were two sibling directories to consolidate.

## Advanced Configuration

### Origin Path Pattern

The origin path pattern feature allows you to configure the S3 bucket path structure that CloudFront uses as the content source. This advanced feature enables the invalidator to work with different directory structures beyond the default `/{stageId}/public` pattern.

#### Default Pattern

By default, the system expects S3 buckets to use the `/{stageId}/public` pattern:

```
bucket-name/
├── prod/
│   └── public/
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── styles.css
│       └── images/
├── stage/
│   └── public/
│       └── ...
└── test/
    └── public/
        └── ...
```

This is the **recommended configuration** for most use cases as it:
- Clearly separates production and non-production content
- Automatically filters non-production stages (dev, test)
- Works seamlessly with multi-stage deployments
- Reduces the number of S3 buckets

#### When to Use Custom Patterns

Consider customizing the origin path pattern when:
- Your S3 bucket uses a different directory structure
- You have legacy buckets that can't be restructured
- You need to support multiple deployment patterns in the same AWS account
- Your CloudFront origin path differs from the default

#### Configuration Methods

There are two ways to configure the origin path pattern:

**1. Application-Wide Configuration (CloudFormation Parameter)**

Set the `OriginPathPattern` parameter during stack deployment to apply a pattern to all buckets:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "OriginPathPattern": "/{stageId}/public",
    "DirectoryConsolidationThreshold": "5",
    "SiblingDirectoryConsolidationThreshold": "5"
  }
}
```

> Note: If your buckets differ widely in structure, you can turn off pre-filtering by the ingestor using `OriginPathPattern: "/"` and tag each bucket that doesn't use root as an origin path with the `invalidator:OriginPathPattern` tag.

**2. Per-Bucket Configuration (S3 Bucket Tag)**

Override the application-wide pattern for specific buckets using the `invalidator:OriginPathPattern` tag.

**Important**: AWS tags do not allow curly braces `{}`, so use `@stageId@` instead of `{stageId}` in bucket tag values. The processor will automatically normalize `@stageId@` to `{stageId}` internally.

**Also Important**: The application filters events as they come in before adding to the queue. In order to use `invalidator:OriginPathPattern` the application-wide pattern must not filter out the bucket-specified pattern. Use `/` to turn off pre-filtering completely. 

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging \
  --bucket your-bucket-name \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[
    {Key=AllowInvalidationEvents,Value=true},
    {Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/public}
  ]'
```

Example with stage placeholder:
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging \
  --bucket your-bucket-name \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[
    {Key=AllowInvalidationEvents,Value=true},
    {Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/@stageId@/public}
  ]'
```

Bucket tags take priority over the CloudFormation parameter, allowing you to handle buckets with different structures in the same AWS account.

#### Valid Pattern Examples

**Standard Multi-Stage Pattern** (default):
```
Pattern: /{stageId}/public
Matches: /prod/public/*, /stage/public/*, /beta/public/*
Filters: /dev/public/*, /test/public/*
```

**Single Public Directory**:
```
Pattern: /public
Matches: /public/*
Behavior: All content treated as production
```

**Custom Stage Location**:
```
Pattern: /{stageId}/assets
Matches: /prod/assets/*, /stage/assets/*
Filters: /dev/assets/*, /test/assets/*
```

**Root-Level Pattern**:
```
Pattern: /
Matches: All paths in bucket
Behavior: Entire bucket treated as production content unless bucket tag `invalidator:OriginPathPattern` is present.
```

**Deep Nested Pattern**:
```
Pattern: /{stageId}/web/public
Matches: /prod/web/public/*, /stage/web/public/*
Filters: /dev/web/public/*, /test/web/public/*
```

#### Pattern Validation Rules

Origin path patterns must follow these rules:

1. **Must start with `/`** - Patterns must begin with a forward slash
2. **Must not end with `/`** - Trailing slashes are not allowed
3. **Valid characters only** - Use a-z, A-Z, 0-9, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and curly braces for placeholder
4. **Placeholder format** - Only `{stageId}` is allowed as a placeholder (curly braces can only wrap the literal text "stageId") (Use `@stageId@` in bucket tags)

**Valid patterns**:
- `/{stageId}/public`
- `/public`
- `/{stageId}/assets`
- `/web/{stageId}/public`

**Invalid patterns**:
- `public` (missing leading slash)
- `/public/` (trailing slash)
- `/{stage}/public` (invalid placeholder)
- `/{stageId}/{env}/public` (multiple placeholders not supported)

#### Stage Filtering Behavior

The `{stageId}` placeholder enables automatic stage filtering:

**Production Stage Identifiers** (allowed):
- `prod`
- `beta`
- `stage`
- `staging`

**Non-Production Stage Identifiers** (filtered):
- `dev`
- `test`

When a pattern contains `{stageId}`:
- Only production stages trigger cache invalidations
- Non-production stages are filtered at the Ingestor function
- Each stage is processed separately during consolidation

When a pattern does NOT contain `{stageId}`:
- All matching paths are treated as production
- No stage-based filtering occurs
- All content triggers cache invalidations

#### Fallback Behavior

If an S3 event path doesn't match the configured pattern, the system falls back to detecting the `public` segment:

1. **Pattern Match Attempt**: First tries to match the configured pattern
2. **Public Segment Detection**: If no match, looks for "public" directory in the path
3. **Stage Filtering**: Filters non-production stages found before the "public" segment
4. **Event Rejection**: If neither match, the event is filtered out

This fallback ensures backward compatibility with existing deployments.

#### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Legacy Bucket with Flat Structure**

Your bucket stores all production content at the root:

```
bucket-name/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── images/
```

Configuration:
```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "OriginPathPattern": "/"
  }
}
```

Result: All files trigger invalidations, no stage filtering.

**Example 2: Mixed Bucket Structures**

You have multiple buckets with different structures:

- Bucket A: Uses `/{stageId}/public`
- Bucket B: Uses `/public`
- Bucket C: Uses `/{stageId}/assets`
- Bucket D: Uses `/`

Configuration:
```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "OriginPathPattern": "/"
  }
}
```

Then add bucket tags:
```bash
# Bucket A override (note: use @stageId@ in bucket tags, not {stageId})
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket bucket-a \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/@stageId@/public}]'

# Bucket B override
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket bucket-b \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/public}]'

# Bucket C override (note: use @stageId@ in bucket tags, not {stageId})
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket bucket-c \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/@stageId@/assets}]'

# Bucket D override
aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket bucket-c \
  --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=invalidator:OriginPathPattern,Value=/}]'
```

Result: Each bucket uses its specific pattern.

> Note: If `/public` was used as OriginPathPattern then any event arriving from buckets a, c, and d would be filtered out and not processed. You must use the least restrictive `OriginPathPattern` setting for your stack.

**Example 3: Custom Assets Directory**

Your CloudFront distribution uses `/assets` as the origin path:

```
bucket-name/
├── prod/
│   └── assets/
│       ├── css/
│       ├── js/
│       └── images/
└── stage/
    └── assets/
        └── ...
```

Configuration:
```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "OriginPathPattern": "/{stageId}/assets"
  }
}
```

Result: System processes `/prod/assets/*` and `/stage/assets/*`, filters `/*`, `/dev/assets/*` and `/test/assets/*`.

#### Troubleshooting

**Events Not Being Processed**:

1. Check the pattern matches your S3 bucket structure
2. Verify the pattern follows validation rules
3. Review Ingestor Lambda logs for filtering decisions
4. Confirm bucket tags are correctly formatted

**Wrong Paths Being Invalidated**:

1. Verify the pattern depth matches your CloudFront origin path
2. Check for bucket tag overrides
3. Review Processor Lambda logs for pattern resolution
4. Confirm stage identifiers are correctly placed in paths

**Non-Production Content Being Invalidated**:

1. Ensure pattern includes `{stageId}` placeholder
2. Verify stage identifiers match production list (prod, beta, stage, staging)
3. Check that non-production stages (dev, test) are before the public/assets segment
4. Review event filtering logs in Ingestor function

**Pattern Validation Errors During Deployment**:

1. Verify pattern starts with `/` and doesn't end with `/`
2. Check that only `{stageId}` is used as placeholder
3. Ensure no invalid characters in pattern
4. Review CloudFormation error messages for specific constraint violations

#### Monitoring Pattern Usage

Check Lambda logs to verify pattern configuration:

```bash
# View Ingestor pattern matching decisions
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/PREFIX-PROJECT-STAGE-ingestor --follow

# View Processor pattern resolution
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/PREFIX-PROJECT-STAGE-processor --follow

# Query for pattern-related logs
aws logs start-query \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/PREFIX-PROJECT-STAGE-processor \
  --start-time $(date -d '10 minutes ago' +%s) \
  --end-time $(date +%s) \
  --query-string 'fields @timestamp, bucketName, pattern, source | filter @message like /pattern/ | sort @timestamp desc'
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Use Default When Possible**: The `/{stageId}/public` pattern is recommended for most deployments
2. **Test Pattern Changes**: Verify pattern changes in a test environment before production
3. **Document Custom Patterns**: Record why specific patterns were chosen for each bucket
4. **Monitor After Changes**: Watch invalidation behavior after pattern updates
5. **Use Bucket Tags for Exceptions**: Keep application-wide pattern simple, use tags for special cases
6. **Consider Multiple Stacks**: For complex environments with many different patterns, deploy separate invalidator stacks

#### Multiple Invalidator Stacks

For complex environments with significantly different bucket structures, consider deploying multiple invalidator stacks:

**When to Use Multiple Stacks**:
- Different teams manage different bucket structures
- Legacy and modern buckets coexist
- Distinct environments require different processing rules
- Simplified configuration management is preferred

**Example Multi-Stack Setup**:

```bash
# Stack 1: Modern buckets with /{stageId}/public
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX cdn-invalidator-modern test
# Set OriginPathPattern: /{stageId}/public

# Stack 2: Legacy buckets with /public
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX cdn-invalidator-legacy test
# Set OriginPathPattern: /public

# Stack 3: Assets buckets with /{stageId}/assets
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX cdn-invalidator-assets test
# Set OriginPathPattern: /{stageId}/assets
```

Then configure each S3 bucket to send events to the appropriate invalidator stack ARN.

This approach:
- Simplifies configuration (no bucket tag overrides needed)
- Provides clear separation of concerns
- Enables independent scaling and monitoring
- Reduces complexity in pattern resolution logic

## Validation

### Step 1: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check CloudFormation stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name atlantis-cloudfront-invalidation-prod \
  --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'

# Verify Lambda functions are deployed
aws lambda list-functions \
  --query 'Functions[?contains(FunctionName, `cloudfront-invalidation`)].{Name:FunctionName,Runtime:Runtime,LastModified:LastModified}'
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check Lambda environment variables
aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name atlantis-cloudfront-invalidation-prod-processor \
  --query 'Environment.Variables.{DirectoryThreshold:DIRECTORY_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD,SiblingThreshold:SIBLING_DIRECTORY_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD,StopLevel:CONSOLIDATION_STOP_LEVEL,WindowSeconds:AGGREGATION_WINDOW_SECONDS}'

# Verify bucket tags
aws s3api get-bucket-tagging --bucket your-bucket-name
```

### Step 3: Test Functionality

```bash
# A test file is available in the root of this repo. Increment the target file name on each copy
aws s3 cp test.html s3://BUCKET_NAME/test/public/test-1.html
# - The Ingestor function should accept and then filter OUT the event (it is in test)

# Copy to S3 prod location
aws s3 cp test.html s3://BUCKET_NAME/prod/public/test-2.html
# The Ingestor function should accept and schedule an invalidation. It should be listed in SQS and DynamoDB
# The Processor function should kick in after 5 minutes and submit an invalidation

# Test a bunch of files at once:
cd application-infrastructure/build-scripts
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME

# Test with custom origin path pattern (if your bucket uses a non-standard structure):
python3 ./upload-test-files.py --buckets BUCKET_NAME --origin_path /app/{stageId}

# Monitor Ingestor Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/atlantis-cloudfront-invalidation-prod-ingestor --follow

# Wait 5+ minutes, then monitor Processor Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/atlantis-cloudfront-invalidation-prod-processor --follow
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration Usage

Check logs for configuration decisions:

```bash
# Query for configuration resolution logs
aws logs start-query \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/atlantis-cloudfront-invalidation-prod-processor \
  --start-time $(date -d '10 minutes ago' +%s) \
  --end-time $(date +%s) \
  --query-string 'fields @timestamp, bucketName, directoryThreshold, siblingThreshold, stopLevel, source | filter @message like /effective configuration/ | sort @timestamp desc'
```

Check CloudFront Distribution Invalidation Status:

```bash
aws cloudfront list-invalidations --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID
```

The output will be in JSON format (by default) and contain a list of invalidation summaries. The most recent one will typically be at the top of the Items list.

```json
{
    "InvalidationList": {
        "Items": [
            {
                "Id": "I12345EXAMPLE",
                "Status": "Completed",
                "CreateTime": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
            },
            {
                "Id": "I67890EXAMPLE",
                "Status": "Completed",
                "CreateTime": "2024-12-31T10:00:00.000Z"
            }
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```

Take the `Id` of the most recent invalidation (e.g., `I12345EXAMPLE`) and use it with the `get-invalidation` command.

```bash
aws cloudfront get-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --id I12345EXAMPLE
```

```json
{
    "Invalidation": {
        "Id": "I12345EXAMPLE",
        "Status": "Completed",
        "CreateTime": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "InvalidationBatch": {
            "Paths": {
                "Quantity": 2,
                "Items": [
                    "/path/to/file.css",
                    "/images/*"
                ]
            },
            "CallerReference": "cli-example-ref"
        }
    }
}
```

The `Status` field will indicate the current status (e.g., `InProgress` or `Completed`), and the `Paths` section under `InvalidationBatch` will list the specific paths that were requested for invalidation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Parameter Validation Errors**:
   - Check parameter value ranges
   - Verify parameter file format
   - Review CloudFormation template constraints

2. **IAM Permission Issues**:
   - Verify deployment role has required permissions
   - Check service role policies
   - Review resource-based policies

3. **Resource Naming Conflicts**:
   - Ensure unique stack names
   - Check for existing resources with same names
   - Verify prefix and project ID combinations

### Post-Deployment Issues

1. **Configuration Not Applied**:
   - Check Lambda environment variables
   - Verify CloudFormation parameter values
   - Review bucket tag formatting

2. **Functionality Issues**:
   - Check S3 event configuration
   - Verify bucket and distribution tags
   - Review IAM permissions for Lambda functions

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Configuration Troubleshooting Guide](CONFIGURATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Best Practices

### Deployment

1. **Test in Non-Production First**: Always deploy to TEST environment before PROD
2. **Use Parameter Files**: Maintain consistent configuration across deployments
3. **Monitor Deployments**: Watch CloudFormation events and Lambda function updates
4. **Validate After Deployment**: Test functionality before declaring success

### Configuration Management

1. **Document Configuration Decisions**: Record why specific settings were chosen
2. **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow established patterns for resource names
3. **Monitor Configuration Usage**: Track which buckets use custom settings
4. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and optimize configuration

### Operations

1. **Monitor Key Metrics**: Track consolidation effectiveness and error rates
2. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alarms for configuration issues
3. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep deployment and configuration guides current
4. **Plan for Growth**: Consider configuration needs as system scales

## Development and Deploy Process

Always make and commit your changes in `dev`

Perform merges to advance code to the next branch. `dev` -> `test` -> `beta` -> `main`

```bash
git switch dev
git switch test
git merge dev
git push
# Always return to dev for new changes
git switch dev
```

When you are ready to move code to the next stage, merge:

```bash
git switch test
git pull # always a good idea
git switch beta
git pull # always a good idea
git merge test
git push
# Always return to dev for new changes
git switch dev
```

### Setting Up Pipelines

For each branch/stage you wish to deploy from, set up a pipeline using your organization's central Atlantis SAM Config repository.

There are several pipeline configurations to choose from. If you prefer to not use the branch merge strategy (`dev` -> `test` -> `beta` -> `main`) you can configure the pipeline to use an approval and promotion strategy instead. Cross account configuration is also available.

All Atlantis pipeline templates support approval with promotion and cross-account deployment.

#### Standard Branch-Merge-Based

This will set up deployments for each branch and you will merge changes between them to deploy (`dev` -> `test` -> `beta` -> `main`).

- This is the least complex as it is all Git-based (no logging into the console for approvals.)
- **HOWEVER**: It requires discipline, only forward merges, and squash merges may produce unpredictable results.

Choose template-pipeline.yml (CodeCommit source) or template-pipeline-github.yml and do not enable the approval and promotion configuration. 

```bash
# Create a pipeline for the beta branch
./cli/config.py pipeline PREFIX YOUR_PROJECT_ID beta --profile default
# Choose template-pipeline.yml (CodeCommit source) or template-pipeline-github.yml

# Deploy the pipeline (if you didn't choose to deploy right away from the config script)
./cli/deploy.py pipeline PREFIX YOUR_PROJECT_ID beta --profile default
```

#### Approve/Promote and/or Cross-Account

> Cross-account deployments must use the approve/promote configuration.

This will set up an automatic Git-based deployment for the `test` branch but to deploy your application to subsequent stages you will need to:

1. Configure the `test` pipeline to promote to the next stage
2. All subsequent deployment stages use `template-pipeline-s3-source.yml`

Automated deployment process using approve/promote:

1. The test pipeline will still run automatically when changes are merged to the `test` branch.
2. Then, to promote to the next stage, go into the console for the test pipeline and choose approve promotion.
3. The pipeline will then drop the deployment artifact in an S3 bucket, triggering the next pipeline (which can either be in the same account, or in a separate PROD account depending on your organization's policies).
4. The receiving pipeline will then pick up the new artifact from S3 and await an approval to deploy.
5. The end of this pipeline can also have an approval/promote option. (In case you deploy from test to beta to prod).

You will still need to create one pipeline per stage and only the test branch will have a corresponding stage. (However, you _can_ set up the main branch, or any branch, to deploy to the initial "test" pipeline, it doesn't need to be the `test` branch. Just be sure to set the `StageId` to `test`). You can always create temporary pipelines using `template-pipeline.yml`/`template-pipeline-github.yml` for feature and bug fix test branches.

> By default approval is required to promote and deploy both at the end of the pipeline (promote) and at the start of the next stage (approve). This provides optimal protection against run-away deployments. If you want to disable either the promote or deploy approval, it is recommended you disable the deploy approval at the start of the receiving stage to avoid creating too many deploy artifact versions.

## Support

For deployment support:

1. **Check CloudFormation Events**: Review stack events for deployment issues
2. **Review Lambda Logs**: Check function logs for runtime issues
